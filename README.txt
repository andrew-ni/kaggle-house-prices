Preprocessing sample data (datacleaning3.py) to standard format so we can fit it to our algorithm functions. Main.py runs the training data (train.csv) through linear regression, linear regression with feature selection, random forest, and gradient descent (as provided by the sklearn packages).

train.csv is split into training and testing set
main.py uses functions from datacleaning3.py

train.csv needs to be in the same directory as the .py files

Just run main.py

Uses: 
  python 3.6
  numpy, scipy, and sklearn packages
